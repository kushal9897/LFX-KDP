# Proposal: Combined Design for Kyverno CLI apply and test Commands

## 1. Overall Purpose

### apply Command:
Simulates the application of mutation policies (MAP/MP) on Kubernetes resource manifests in a dry-run mode. This shows the final mutated resource (as YAML or JSON) without modifying any live resources.

### test Command:
Executes policies against predefined test cases to validate policy behavior. It compares the actual mutated resource with the expected output from a test manifest and generates a report showing pass/fail results.

## 2. Inputs and Outputs

### For the apply Command

#### Inputs:
- **Policy Files:**
  - YAML or JSON files defining mutation policies.
  - Input via positional arguments or `-p` flag.
- **Resource Files:**
  - YAML or JSON files representing Kubernetes resources.
  - Input via `--resource` (or `-r`) flag.
- **Optional Flags:**
  - `--output (-o)`: Specifies a file or directory where mutated outputs are saved.
  - `--namespace (-n)`: Limits resource scope to a specific namespace.
  - `--set`: Passes variable overrides to policies.
  - `--cluster`: Fetches resources directly from the cluster.
  - `--json`: Supports JSON payloads.
  - `--detailed-results`: When enabled, prints the full mutated YAML for each resource.

#### Outputs:
- **Mutated Resource YAML/JSON:**
  - Displayed on the console or written to a file if `--output` is specified.
- **Status and Log Messages:**
  - Indicates whether a policy was applied, skipped, or encountered errors.
- **Detailed Output:**
  - When the `--detailed-results` flag is active, prints the entire mutated resource in YAML.

### For the test Command

#### Inputs:
- **Test Manifest File:**
  - A YAML file (e.g., `kyverno-test.yaml`) that defines test cases.
  - Each test case includes:
    - **Policy Files:** Policies to test.
    - **Input Resources:** The resources to be mutated.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The expected mutated output or pass/fail expectation.
- **Additional Flags:**
  - `--resource-path`: Directory containing test resource files.
  - `--detailed-results`: Displays detailed diffs for failed tests.
  - `--test-case-selector`: Filters and runs a subset of tests.

#### Outputs:
- **Test Report:**
  - A summary table or list showing pass/fail status for each test case.
- **Detailed Diff (if enabled):**
  - Line-by-line comparison of expected vs. actual output for failed tests.
- **Status Messages:**
  - Overall test summary indicating the number of passed, failed, or skipped tests.
- **Exit Codes:**
  - Exit code `0` for success (all tests pass) or a non-zero value if any test fails.
  - 
## 3. Workflow Summary

### Input Phase:
- **For apply:**
  - User provides policy files, resource files, and optional flags (e.g., `--cluster`, `--output`, `--detailed-results`).
- **For test:**
  - User provides a test manifest file that specifies test cases (including input resources, policies, and expected outputs).

### Processing Phase:
- **Apply Command:**
  - Load and validate policies and resources.
  - Simulate the application of mutation rules.
  - If `--detailed-results` is enabled, output the full mutated resource YAML.
- **Test Command:**
  - Load the test manifest.
  - Execute each test case by applying policies and comparing results with expectations.
  - Collect and aggregate test results.

### Output Phase:
- **Apply Command:**
  - Print or save the mutated resource.
  - Display status messages (policy applied, skipped, error).
- **Test Command:**
  - Display a report showing pass/fail status for each test case.
  - Print detailed diffs for failures when `--detailed-results` is enabled.
  - Provide an overall summary of the test results.
